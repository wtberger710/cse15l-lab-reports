# Alternatives to the `grep` command:
The first alternative to `grep` is `grep -R term` which finds the file path as well as where the file can be located. 
An example for this command is shown below:
```
[cs15lwi23aac@ieng6-201]:berlitz2:525$ grep -R 'margaritas'
Vallarta-History.txt:The first airplanes from the US began to arrive in the mid-1930s, and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors, from movie stars to presidents, writers to millionaires. Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous. Glitzy hotels went up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power plants, and a superhighway. Acapulco’s peak was the 1940s to 1960s. Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada, President Eisenhower meeting Mexico’s President López Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel, and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco Bay.
Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt:Mexico’s folkloric traditions have become the centerpiece of the modern “Mexican Fiesta,” created especially with the tourist in mind. These full evenings of entertainment generally include a makeshift marketplace featuring artesanía for sale, a buffet Mexican dinner, games (involving drinking large quantities of tequila), mariachi music, a presentation of folkloric dance from around the country, and a generous supply of margaritas and other beverages. Most of the time these are smallish presentations, with dances performed by amateur groups; at their worst, they can be truly gaudy and almost laughable shows.
Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt:Tequila and mezcal. What better place to get the real thing than a Mexican resort that just happens to be located in the state where all tequila is produced? Puerto Vallarta is located 330 km (205 miles) from the source of all production, the town of Tequila. A good bottle of tequila — made, bought, and sampled in Jalisco — has no match. Make certain to look for the Agave Azul (100% blue agave) legend on the bottle to ensure you are purchasing Tequila’s best. One of the best paces to buy a bottle is the Casa del Tequila in downtown Puerto Vallarta. They regularly host samplings, serve up the best margaritas on the coast, and provide free informational pamphlets (in English and Spanish) on the history, types, and lore of tequila. (Also see page 93.)
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:In recent years there has been a significant shift away from the traditional attractions of sunny beaches and generous margaritas to an outstanding array of ecologically sensitive excursions and soft adventures. With the Sierra Madre mountains dominating the eastern horizon, Vallarta sits at the center of 26 miles of beaches that border Banderas Bay, giving it a natural appeal. The varied geography attracts hikers, mountain bikers, sea kayakers, whale-watchers, and divers.

A second example of the `grep -R` command is:
```
[cs15lwi23aac@ieng6-201]:berlitz2:528$ grep -R 'Puerto Escondido'
Vallarta-History.txt:Puerto Escondido and Huatulco
Vallarta-History.txt:Even though Puerto Escondido is the more mature tourist destination of the two, Huatulco has the deepest historical roots. The Aztecs and Chichimecs (a Nahuatl-speaking warrior community) knew Huatulco as an important trading port long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.
Vallarta-History.txt:Puerto Escondido was established in 1928 as a port for shipping coffee. Its importance diminished as coffee shipments began to be transported by truck. In the 1960s tourists discovered the town after it was connected to other coastal towns by Highway 200. With its renowned offshore break, Puerto Escondido became the ultimate destination for backpackers, flower children, surfers looking for the perfect wave, and those attracted by natural beauty and the laid-back pace. True escapists preferred to continue south and visit Puerto Angel, a fishing village that was Oaxaca’s busiest port for a brief period in the 1870s, before reverting back to its peaceable ways.
Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt:Puerto Escondido’s Zicatela Beach is considered one of the best surfing beaches in the world, and is the site of an important surfing competition every August. San Blas, located 225 km (150 miles) northwest of Puerto Vallarta, is another good spot for outstanding surfing waves. The best waves along the Mexican coast are caught during the fall. San Blas has a much smaller tourist infrastructure than Puerto Escondido, and word-of-mouth is the best way to learn the secrets of the best beaches and current breaks. Another good option is to contact Surf-Mex (Tel. (3) 223-1680), based in Puerto Vallarta, who offer surf tours and lessons, from rank beginners on up to expert wave-riders.
Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt:Another seasonal, and very worthwhile eco-conscious activity, is to participate in the nightly sea turtle releases and watches that take place from August through November along the shores of Banderas Bay, and further south in Mazunte (located between Huatulco and Puerto Escondido). Preservation groups and trained specialists conduct these releases and watches. You participate by helping to collect the turtles’ eggs and taking them to a safe nesting area for incubation. After the baby turtles hatch, they are released back into the ocean. Organized visits to the turtle camps are conducted daily in Mazunte, at the Centro Mexicano de la Tortuga, and in Puerto Vallarta by several of the beachfront hotels and a select group of ecologically oriented tour operators, such as Eco-tours de México (Tel. (3) 222-6606).
Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt:In Puerto Escondido and Huatulco, you’ll find an abundance of tequila’s close cousin, mezcal. Mezcal is distilled from the juice of more common types of maguey plants found in the central region of Mexico. It has a stronger taste and smell than tequila. Oaxacan mezcal is the type that is bottled with a maguey worm pickled in the bottom of the bottle. To the ancient Mexicans, the maguey plant was considered sacred, and the fact that the worm had ingested a part of the “spirit” of this revered plant made consuming them both a delicacy and a way to obtain good luck. Salud!
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:Puerto Escondido 
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:For years, Puerto Escondido  — called simply “Puerto” by the locals — has been known as a surfers’ haven, due to the awesome break at Playa Zicatela, known as “The Mexican Pipeline.” The site of annual international surf competitions during fall swells, it continues to draw those in search of the perfect wave as well as scores of travelers content to gaze at the ocean, soak up the sun, and chat about the experience over a cold beer or iced latte. Puerto Escondido is currently popular with younger, predominately European travelers, and, simply stated , offers the best overall value in a Mexican beach vacation today.
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:Puerto Angelito and Playa Manzanillo share the same sheltered cove, but are separated by a rocky outcropping. Located just west of town, they are accessible by walking from town along a dirt road, or by a launch taxi boat from the main beach. Here, the surf subsides enough for comfortable swimming, and hammock and palapa shade rentals are available. This is Puerto Escondido’s best spot for snorkeling.
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:Day Trips from Puerto Escondido
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:The diverse geography surrounding Puerto Escondido is complemented by a collection of small coastal towns, making it an ideal place from which to explore some uniquely Mexican cultural experiences.
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:The beaches south of Puerto Escondido are prime nesting grounds for the endangered Ridley sea turtles. During the summer months, visitors to this area may encounter turtles laying their eggs in the sand, or hatchlings making their first instinctive voyage to sea. The Centro Mexicano la Tortuga aquarium and research center was established by the Mexican government in 1991, in the beach village of Mazunte. Located about 72 km (45 miles) south of Puerto Escondido, (take the clearly marked turnoff to Puerto Angel from Mex. 200 south) it showcases the various species of turtles found along Mexican beaches, and is involved in efforts along this coast to protect the turtle nests.
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:The beaches to the north and south of Puerto Escondido are interspersed with lagoons, estuaries, and mangrove swamps, which contribute to making this region a fertile ecological paradise. About 24 km (15 miles) west of Puerto Escondido is Laguna Manialtepec, a deep lagoon, thick with vegetation and brimming with tropical birds, including the ibis, a variety of herons, parrots, egrets, and several species of ducks.
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:The 50-square mile national park, Lagunas de Chacahua is located 66 km (41 miles) to the north of Puerto Escondido. It is comprised of 32 km (20 miles) of fine, sandy beaches, backed by a pair of lagoons and jungle mangroves teeming with a changing array of tropical and migratory birds. Though crocodiles were hunted out in the 1970s, a crocodile hatchery in the village of Chacahua, located on the western edge of the lagoon, is steadily bringing them back.
Vallarta-WhereToGo.txt:Heading into the foothills of the Sierra de Miahuatlán, located north of Puerto Escondido, are numerous trails for hiking or horseback riding. This mountainous jungle region also features a few places of particular interest, including the Atotonilco hot springs, considered to be healing waters by the indigenous Chatino residents of the area. The El Macuil waterfall is not only a spectacular site, but offers cool, natural freshwater pools for swimming. Another waterfall can be enjoyed near the mountain village of San Gabriel Mixtepec, a small town nestled between several coffee plantations. Nearby, the Mixtec village of Jamiltepec offers a rare look at a quiet, traditional, indigenous town.

This command is useful because it effectively combines two commands. Not only does it return text containing the phrase you searched for, but also the locations of those text files containing the desired phrase.

A second alternative to the `grep` command is the `grep -c [word file]` command. An example is shown below:
```
[cs15lwi23aac@ieng6-201]:berlitz2:545$ grep -c 'Beach' Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
2
```
A second example of this command is:
```
[cs15lwi23aac@ieng6-201]:berlitz2:547$ grep -c 'tequila' Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt
3
```

This makes the job of figuring out the number of times a word or phrase appears in a file much easier. It also eliminates human error.

The third alternative to `grep` is `grep 'word' [fileName]`

[cs15lwi23aac@ieng6-201]:berlitz2:551$ grep 'Bahamas' Bahamas-History.txt
Centuries before the arrival of Columbus, a peaceful Amerindian people who called themselves the Luccucairi had settled in the Bahamas. Originally from South America, they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands, surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore. Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on 12 October 1492. Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians. We know them today as the Lucayans. Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons, but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking, he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards Cuba.
The Spaniards never bothered to settle in the Bahamas, but the number of shipwrecks attest that their galleons frequently passed through the archipelago en route to and from the Caribbean, Florida, Bermuda, and their home ports. On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
English sea captains also came to know the beautiful but deserted Bahamian islands during the 17th century. England’s first formal move was on 30 October 1629, when Charles I granted the Bahamas and a chunk of the American south to his Attorney General, Sir Robert Health. But nothing came of that, nor of a rival French move in 1633 when Cardinal Richelieu, the 17th-century French statesman, tried claiming the islands for France.
In 1648 a group of English Puritans from Bermuda, led by William Sayle, sailed to Bahamian waters and established the first permanent European settlement on the island they named Eleutheria (now Eleuthera) after the Greek word for freedom. The 70 colonists called themselves the Eleutherian Adventurers, but life was very difficult and the colony never flourished, though Sayle was long honored for the effort. In 1666 a smaller island (called Sayle’s island) with a fine harbor was settled by Bermudians and renamed New Providence. It was later to become known as Nassau, capital of the Bahamas.
Most feared of the 1,000 or more swashbucklers operating from the New Providence lair was Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. Today you can visit a tower east of Nassau named after him. Another two infamous pirates were women: Anne Bonney and Mary Read had exceptionally bloodthirsty reputations and are still celebrated in the Bahamas. The pirates raided anything on the sea, living totally lawless — and often not very lengthy — lives. Moreover, there was not always a clear distinction between pirates and privateers, the latter officially authorized by their governments to plunder enemy ships during time of war. Anarchy and confusion reigned throughout the area.
In 1718, shortly after the Bahamas became a crown colony, Captain Woodes Rogers, a renowned ex-privateer, was named the first royal governor. Arriving in Nassau with a powerful force and promising amnesty for surrender, he became a legend by cleaning out many of the pirates and establishing some order. This incident inspired the national motto Expulsis Piratis — Restituta Commercia (Pirates Expelled — Commerce Restored), which was retained until 1971.
A few years later Rogers quit the islands only to return for a second time in 1729 after a period of bankruptcy and debtor’s prison in England. Before he died in Nassau in 1732 he had summoned the Bahamas’ first official Assembly, composed of 16 elected members for New Providence and four each for Harbour Island and Eleuthera. At this time, in all the Bahamas there were only about 2,000 settlers.
When the 13 American colonies, enraged by the Stamp Tax, got into the war that eventually brought independence, the Bahamas somewhat reluctantly found itself on England’s side. But reluctance dissolved as profits from privateering once again flowed into Nassau. This time the plundered vessels were American, but not all the victories were won by the privateers. On 3 March 1776, a rebel squadron under Commodore Esek Hopkins arrived and occupied Nassau for two weeks, a bloodless undertaking that emptied the island’s forts of arms and other military supplies. A smaller and equally non-violent American operation against the town in January 1778 lasted less than three days.
As the colonies’ war effort picked up steam, both France and Spain weighed in against the British. In May 1782, New Providence surrendered to a large Spanish-American invasion fleet from Cuba and for the next year a Spanish governor ruled the Bahamas.
News traveled slowly in those days. The Treaty of Versailles in 1783 formally restored the Bahamas to the British, but actual liberation came through a famous escapade that would never have happened in the age of the telegraph. Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Deveaux, a loyalist from South Carolina, sailed from Florida with six ships, picked up men and fishing boats at Harbour Island and Eleuthera, and “invaded” Nassau. Though vastly outnumbered and outgunned, Deveaux employed elaborate ruses with his little boats to convince the Spanish defenders that his force was overpowering. The humiliating Spanish surrender is proudly recalled in Bahamian history, even though it was all unnecessary: the peace treaty had been signed the previous week.
Deveaux was the first of some 7,000 loyalists who, with slaves and the promise of land grants, came to the Bahamas from the southern American colonies in the wake of the English defeat in the Revolutionary War. This influx profoundly affected the islands. A number of prominent Bahamians today are the descendants of loyalists or their slaves. As a reward for his efforts, Deveaux was given acreage on both New Providence and Cat Island. Other loyalists set up cotton plantations on various islands, and slaves soon became the majority of the population.
In the 1780s well over 100 cotton plantations were founded and flourished around the Bahamas. Prosperity from the land finally seemed a possibility. But by the end of the century cotton had fallen victim to a devastating plague of chenille bugs and exhaustion of the weak soil. Most of the planters left the islands and depression returned, only partly relieved by “wrecking,” the freelance business of salvaging cargo from the ships forever running aground in the dangerous Bahamian waters. (Some ships were deliberately misguided by lights on shore; Nassau harbor did not have a proper lighthouse until 1816).
Slavery in the Bahamas was not as widespread or as vicious as on many sugar islands in the Caribbean. Some slaves were voluntarily freed or sold their liberty by loyalist owners. After 1804, no slaves were imported into the Bahamas. By 1822, the first registration counted 10,808 slaves on the 17 inhabited islands or island clusters. After Parliament in London abolished slavery in 1833, there was a transitional apprenticeship period of 5 years before all slaves in the colony became fully free on 1 August 1838. This included a few thousand slaves from ships captured by the Royal Navy. They were housed in specially founded settlements on New Providence and the Out Islands.
Over the centuries, trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas. When Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern states in 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War, theBahamas quickly boomed. Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms, medicine, and manufactured goods, mainly from Europe, to be run back through the northern blockade. As the war went on, speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the ever-increasing Federal patrols. Profits from blockade running were incredible, and Nassau went wild. But the extravagant parties and carefree spending stopped abruptly with the North’s victory in 1865. Late the following year an immense hurricane sent a tidal wave over Hog Island (today Paradise Island), smashing Nassau’s flimsy buildings and ruining crops. Other islands were also devastated. As the Bahamas sank back into economic doldrums, citizens turned to agriculture, fishing, or salt raking. The spread of lighthouses and decent navigational charts had crippled the old standby, the wrecking trade.
Prohibition brought gloom to millions of Americans, but for the Bahamas it brought the biggest bonanza in history. At the end of 1919, Congress passed the Volstead Act outlawing the manufacture, sale, or transport of intoxicating beverages. The Bahamian islands (where the temperance crusade never had much chance) were perfectly placed to help thirsty Americans. For 14 years, until the controversial law was finally repealed, bootlegging changed Nassau, West End on Grand Bahama, and Bimini beyond recognition. With just as much gusto as they’d shown in the past for wrecking, privateering, and blockade running, Bahamians took to the seas with illegal liquor. Trying to outwit the US Coast Guard was risky but enormously profitable. Fortunes were made by respected Bahamian families turned liquor merchants, rum-running boat captains, notorious criminals, shady ladies, and the Bahamas government (which collected duty on temporarily imported drink).
When the boom suddenly came to an end with the worldwide depression and the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, unemployment rose again, despite the first significant tourism the Bahamas had known.
In some respects, World War II put the Bahamas on the international map. The colony was chosen to have two of the sites Britain leased to the United States under Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “destroyers for bases” deal in 1940. Allied forces operated submarine-hunting and air-sea rescue stations on the islands; Royal Air Force pilots and Royal Navy frogmen were trained here, and much trans-Atlantic air traffic passed through the Bahamas.
In 1943 the Duke intervened in the investigation of the murder of Canadian multimillionaire Sir Harry Oakes, a longtime benefactor of the Bahamas who gave his name to Nassau’s first airfield. The sensational case, never solved, made world headlines for the Bahamas and is still discussed today.
After the construction of the first wartime American air bases on New Providence was completed, thousands of Bahamians left to work on farms and in factories in the United States, a migration that continued well into the postwar era. But employment opportunities began to grow at home. From 1950, a promotion campaign under Sir Stafford Sands was hugely successful in attracting tourists to the Bahamas. Denied the sun, sand, and sin of Cuba by Fidel Castro’s takeover in 1959, hundreds of thousands of American vacationers set their sights on the Bahamas. The influx was spurred by gambling, airport and harbor improvement on the major islands, and the creation of the modern city of Freeport (which had been set in motion by the so-called Hawksbill Creek Agreement of 1955). Resort hotels began to appear and the advent of air-conditioning improved the often stifling humidity of summer.
Under a new constitution in 1964, the colony was given self-government with a ministerial-parliamentary system. In 1967 elections, the Progressive Liberal Party was victorious, its leader Lynden O. Pindling becoming premier. Following a constitutional conference in London, the Bahamas became fully independent on July 10, 1973, and is now a member of the United Nations and the British Commonwealth. In August 1992 the Progressive Liberal Party, still headed by Lynden O. Pindling, was toppled by the Free National Movement after 25 years in power. Today’s prime minister is Hubert Ingraham.
Since independence the Bahamas has kept British systems of judiciary and government yet has moved closer economically to its near neighbor, the US. The Bahamian Government has deliberately pursued tourism as the major industry of the Bahamian commonwealth and is happy to welcome many millions of visitors to its shores. The growth in cruise traffic has been particularly strong. The other islands, called the Family Islands by the government but generally referred to as the Out Islands by the tourist trade, have not shared this huge growth in numbers of visitors. Together they offer tourists almost any form of vacation experience, from the bustle of the busy city to the silence of the desert island.
In the 1990s the Bahamian Government began working on ways to expand the country’s economic base. While tourism remains a top priority — the opening of the vast Atlantis resort on Paradise Island leaves little doubt about that — a number of measures have also been taken to make the country’s laws and tax codes more attractive to offshore investors. As a result, money has been making its way into financial institutions on the Bahamas from around the world, and a large number of foreign banks have opened brand-new air-conditioned offices surrounded by carefully manicured gardens.
One of the major questions still facing the Bahamas is how to accommodate the increasing numbers of tourists while still preserving the special architectural and social heritage of the Out Islands, as well as of the major towns like Nassau. Will it be possible to enjoy the natural splendors of places like Inagua without upsetting the delicate balance of nature? At the moment, the thinking is that it’s perhaps best to leave these smaller, less developed islands in peace.

[cs15lwi23aac@ieng6-201]:berlitz2:556$ fgrep 'Olympic Games' Barcelona-History.txt
Charismatic Felipe González, a Socialist, was Prime Minister of Spain from 1982 to 1986. Spain became a member of the European Economic Community (now European Union, or EU) in 1986, hastening the country’s modernization. Though González was credited by many as the architect of the new Spain, he finally succumbed to incessant charges of corruption and incompetence in the highest levels of his government. The EU’s freeing of trade tariffs and controls, and Barcelona’s hosting of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, acted as catalysts for the city and Catalonia - Spain’s industrial engine and bridge to the rest of Europe — to embark on a significant economic boom.

[cs15lwi23aac@ieng6-201]:berlitz2:559$ fgrep 'Northwest Territories' Canada-History.txt
The strange European comings and goings were observed by native peoples whose ancestors had preceded these “discoverers” by at least 12,000, some of them 55,000, years. Waves of Siberian hunters had crossed a land bridge over the Bering Strait in pursuit of mammoth and bison. They spread through Alaska, south along the Pacific coast to the region of British Columbia, and later east across the Yukon and Northwest Territories.
Despite a referendum vote by its citizens against separatism two years earlier, Québec was defiantly the only province not to sign the new constitution, feeling its cultural specificity had not been guaranteed. Tory Prime Minister Brian Mulroney won the Québécois over in 1987 with an accord recognizing them as a “distinct society.” He appeased the other provinces by conceding important new powers in shared-cost programs, immigration, and appointments to the Supreme Court and Senate. In the 1990s, Québec has remained a part of the Canadian federation by only the slimmest electoral margins. The Inuit and other indigenous peoples have also negotiated concessions for their lands and resources, and in 1999, the immense Northern Territories divided in two. The eastern half, which takes in Baffin Island, the land around Hudson’s Bay, and most of the Arctic islands, is now called Nunavut and essentially functions as an Inuit homeland. The remaining Northwest Territories officially retain the territory’s old name, though many refer to the region as the Western Arctic. The success of Nunavut has led other native groups to settle claims with the Canadian government. 
These toughest of all Canadians have withstood the hardships of the far north, including its icy deserts and Arctic blizzards, but were nearly wiped out by European diseases — measles, mumps, and smallpox. Estimated at 81,000 in the 18th century, they now number some 27,000, living mostly in the eastern half of the Northwest Territories. They succeeded in having the eastern section of the Northwest Territories officially renamed Nunavut — “Our Land” — and in 1999, Nunavut became the 11th province of Canada. 
Nowhere is the clash of traditional values and modern industry more acute than it is in the western Subarctic. Here, some 11,000 native peoples from 20 tribes in the Northwest Territories sharing the Athapaskan language have joined as the Dene Nation. Together with the Métis Association (descendants of intermarried French fur traders and Plains Indians), they are involved in a tussle with private oil and natural gas companies to protect land rights and traditional culture.
Today, colorful folklore is being revived as an assertion of the indigenous peoples’ identity. But it is in terms of hard, everyday reality that Indians and Inuit have insisted upon, and won the autonomy of partial provincial status for the Yukon and Northwest Territories. They are continually pressing for a greater share in the profits of the oil, uranium, and other energy resources found on the lands allotted them in the 19th century, before these riches were ever dreamed of.

`fgrep` treats the search pattern as a fixed string, not an expression. This is helpful in that it allows you to search for literal strings without worrying about special characters.

I found these commands through ChatGPT, and while it wasn't syntactically accurate for all commands, it was fairly accurate in describing the differences between the altneratives and the original `grep` command itself.
